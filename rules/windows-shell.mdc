# Windows Shell Command Rules

Target shell: Windows PowerShell (see session metadata).

Do not use the following in terminal commands:
- "&&" to chain commands (causes parser errors in this environment)
- "cat" (or piping to cat) for output display

Required practices:
- Run commands separately instead of chaining with "&&".
- For file output, use PowerShell-native commands like `Get-Content` (alias: `gc`) or rely on the command's own output.
- Avoid UNIX-specific utilities; prefer Windows/PowerShell equivalents.
