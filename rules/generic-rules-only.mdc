# Rules Portability and Genericity Standard

All rule files in `.cursor/rules/` MUST be generic and applicable to any codebase.

## Mandatory Requirements

- DO NOT reference project-specific names (app names, commands, file paths, environments, API keys) in rule content
- DO use neutral, portable terms ("the application", "the CLI", "the database", "the container")
- DO express examples using generic placeholders where necessary (e.g., `your_command`, `your_module`, `your_database_url`)
- DO avoid naming concrete services, endpoints, or vendors unless the guidance is vendor-agnostic and broadly applicable

## Enforcement

- Prior to adding or modifying any rule, verify the content contains zero project-specific references
- Replace any discovered project-specific references with generic placeholders
- Keep rationale and patterns technology-agnostic and industry standard

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] No project name references
- [ ] No project-specific CLI commands or flags
- [ ] No hardcoded paths unique to a repository
- [ ] Examples use neutral placeholders
- [ ] Guidance is applicable across multiple stacks and environments
